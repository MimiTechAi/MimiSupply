# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Apple Authentication feature provides secure user authentication for the MimiSupply app using Sign in with Apple. This feature serves as the mandatory authentication method for all user roles (Customer, Driver, Partner, Admin) and integrates with Apple's authentication services to provide a seamless, privacy-focused login experience. The authentication system will store user credentials securely in Keychain and sync user profiles with CloudKit for cross-device functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign in with my Apple ID, so that I can securely access the MimiSupply app without creating additional credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display a Sign in with Apple button prominently on the authentication screen
2. WHEN a user taps the Sign in with Apple button THEN the system SHALL present Apple's authentication flow
3. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Apple THEN the system SHALL receive an authorization code and user identity token
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user's credentials securely in Keychain
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create or update the user profile in CloudKit
6. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL navigate the user to the appropriate home screen based on their role

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to be automatically signed in when I open the app, so that I don't have to authenticate every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app and has previously authenticated THEN the system SHALL check for valid credentials in Keychain
2. WHEN valid credentials exist THEN the system SHALL verify the credentials with Apple's servers
3. WHEN credentials are valid THEN the system SHALL automatically sign the user in and navigate to their home screen
4. WHEN credentials are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to sign in again
5. WHEN automatic sign-in fails THEN the system SHALL display the authentication screen with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign out of my account, so that I can protect my privacy when sharing my device or switching accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the settings or profile screen THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign Out" option
2. WHEN a user taps "Sign Out" THEN the system SHALL present a confirmation dialog
3. WHEN a user confirms sign out THEN the system SHALL remove all stored credentials from Keychain
4. WHEN a user confirms sign out THEN the system SHALL clear any cached user data
5. WHEN sign out is complete THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the authentication screen
6. WHEN sign out is complete THEN the system SHALL revoke the authentication token with Apple

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to work seamlessly across all my Apple devices, so that I can access MimiSupply from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in on one device THEN the system SHALL sync their profile data to CloudKit
2. WHEN a user opens the app on a different device with the same Apple ID THEN the system SHALL retrieve their profile from CloudKit
3. WHEN CloudKit sync is successful THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent user data across devices
4. WHEN CloudKit sync fails THEN the system SHALL store data locally and retry sync when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN a user signs out on one device THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication on other devices unless explicitly signed out

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the authentication flow to be fully accessible, so that I can use the app regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using VoiceOver THEN the system SHALL provide clear audio descriptions for all authentication elements
2. WHEN using Dynamic Type THEN the system SHALL scale all text appropriately for readability
3. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.2 compliance)
4. WHEN using Switch Control THEN the system SHALL allow navigation through all authentication elements
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, accessible error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want authentication errors to be properly handled and logged, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message and log technical details
2. WHEN authentication fails due to user cancellation THEN the system SHALL return to the authentication screen without error messages
3. WHEN authentication fails due to Apple service issues THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
4. WHEN critical authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details to CloudKit for analysis
5. WHEN authentication state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms to restore proper state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to be testable and maintainable, so that I can ensure reliability and add new features safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL provide mock authentication services for testing
2. WHEN running UI tests THEN the system SHALL support automated testing of the authentication flow
3. WHEN authentication components are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing user sessions
4. WHEN new authentication features are added THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture
5. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and debugging information
