## Test Execution

### Running All Tests

```swift
// Run the complete test suite
let coordinator = TestSuiteCoordinator.shared
try await coordinator.runUnitTestSuite()
try await coordinator.runIntegrationTestSuite()
try await coordinator.runUITestSuite()
try await coordinator.runPerformanceTestSuite()
```

### Running Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Unit tests only
xcodebuild test -scheme MimiSupply -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing:MimiSupplyTests

# UI tests only
xcodebuild test -scheme MimiSupply -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing:MimiSupplyUITests

# Performance tests only
xcodebuild test -scheme MimiSupply -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing:MimiSupplyTests/Performance
```

## Test Coverage Requirements

- **Overall Coverage**: > 85%
- **Business Logic Coverage**: > 90%
- **UI Coverage**: > 80%
- **Integration Coverage**: > 75%

## Performance Benchmarks

### Startup Performance
- Cold start: < 2.5 seconds
- Warm start: < 1.0 second
- First screen TTI: < 1.0 second

### Runtime Performance

## Mock Data and Test Fixtures

The test suite includes comprehensive mock data for:
- Partners with various categories and ratings
- Products with different price ranges and availability
- Orders in various states
- Users with different roles and permissions
- Location data for testing geographic features

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD environments with:
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Device matrix testing (iPhone, iPad, different iOS versions)
- Accessibility testing with assistive technologies
- Performance regression detection
- Visual regression testing with snapshot comparisons

## Test Quality Metrics

The test suite monitors:
- Test execution time (average < 5 seconds per test)
- Test reliability (> 95% success rate)
- Flaky test detection (< 5% flaky tests)
- Code coverage trends
- Performance regression detection

## Requirements Traceability

All tests are mapped to specific requirements from the requirements document:
- Requirement 1.x: Explore-First User Experience
- Requirement 2.x: Authentication and Role Management
- Requirement 3.x: Customer Experience
- Requirement 4.x: Driver Experience
- Requirement 5.x: Partner Experience
- Requirements 6.x-15.x: System requirements (performance, accessibility, etc.)

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
2. **Mock Usage**: External dependencies are mocked for reliable testing
3. **Data Cleanup**: Tests clean up after themselves to prevent side effects
4. **Async Testing**: Proper async/await usage for modern Swift testing
5. **Error Testing**: Both success and failure scenarios are tested
6. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and edge cases are covered
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Performance tests prevent regressions
8. **Accessibility First**: All UI tests include accessibility validation

## Maintenance

- Tests are updated with each feature addition
- Mock data is kept in sync with production data models
- Performance benchmarks are reviewed quarterly
- Accessibility tests are updated with new WCAG guidelines
- Snapshot tests are regenerated when UI changes are intentional

This comprehensive testing suite ensures the MimiSupply app maintains high quality, performance, and accessibility standards throughout its development lifecycle.
